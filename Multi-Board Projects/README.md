# Multi-Board Projects
Projects involving multiple different boards which cannot be easily organized alone in the boards project directory. 

Currently the only project I have that meets this category is my Dragon Skull Halloween Mask which has 3 different microcontrollers inside.  

Eventually I'm hoping to port the entire project to an Adafruit Scorpio board in 2023 and this category will hopefully disappear.
