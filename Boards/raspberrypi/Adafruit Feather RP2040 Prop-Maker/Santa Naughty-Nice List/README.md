# Santa's Naughty & Nice List
- Uses tactile switches to change MP3 and animation.
- As of Circuit Python 9.0 it does not support MP3's for ESP32 microcontrollers.
You can get this to work on an ESP32 but you'll have to use WAV files instead of MP3.
If you want MP3's please use an RP2040 based chip such as the RP2040 Prop-Maker Feather used in this example.
