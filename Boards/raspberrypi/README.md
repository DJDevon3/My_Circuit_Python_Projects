Raspberry Pi has become a household name and for good reason. Their boards have helped spark the imaginations of young and old the world over. Adafruit offers a wide selection of RP based boards from the Pi 3/4 to the new Feather RP2040, KB2040, and Pico W. Raspberry Pi boards run very well on Circuit Python.

The projects in this section are specifically for RP based boards running Circuit Python.
