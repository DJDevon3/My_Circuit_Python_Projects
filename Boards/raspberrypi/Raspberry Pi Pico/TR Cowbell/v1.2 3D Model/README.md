I've included a 3D model of the board for the purposes of custom enclosures. I noticed when I imported it into Fusion 360 the dimensions were about 200% bigger so please ensure the dimensions are calibrated correctly prior to beginning an enclosure design.

I will be cleaning up the model and ensuring it's sized correctly over the holidays. My next task is creating an enclosure so this is a placeholder for that but in case you want to hit the ground running and design your own at least a basic mesh is already provided.

Here are the exact board measurements in order to calibrate the 3D model if there is any size distortion during importing to your preferred 3D program.

Screw holes above and below the step switches are identically spaced so setting up a repeating pattern is easy. Unfortunately the other screw holes around the perimeter of the board are not aligned and eyeballed. Some are staggered & offset from each other so you cannot use a repeating pattern on them.

### 3D Printing
I've finished the enclosure design and all the files are now available labeled as v78. I recommend using the .f3d project file with Fusion 360 as it will have everything nicely laid out.  If you're importing to another program you can reference the images above to ensure dimensions are correct.
