# NRF52840 Feather Bluefruit Sense
This board features a ton of built-in sensors including light sensor, accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetomer, sound sensor, temp sensor, humidity sensor, pressure sensor, and altitude sensor. That's a lot of sensors! It doesn't do Wifi but it does Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). This is one of Adafruit's most expensive all-in-one sensor development boards for Circuit Python. It's an excellent board for anyone from beginners to experts and is often out of stock. When it comes back in stock it usually sells out again pretty quick.
