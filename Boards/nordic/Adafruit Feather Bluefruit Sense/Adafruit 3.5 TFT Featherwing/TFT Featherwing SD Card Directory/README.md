# Required Hardware:
- Adafruit Feather (NRF52840 in this example) running Circuit Python 7.3.x
- Adafruit TFT (2.5" or 3.5") Featherwing
- SD Card (FAT32, FAT16, ExFat)

Show volume information, directories, and files on your Featherwing SD Card to your Featherwing TFT display.

System Volume Information directory, WPSettings.dat, & IndexerVolumeGuid are files automatically created by Windows storage service if you use the SD Card with a card reader on Windows OS. They're  normal expected files for Windows users and are safe to delete from your SD card.
