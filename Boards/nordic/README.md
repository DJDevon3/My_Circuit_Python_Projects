Adafruit has a solid variety of boards using NRF chips aimed at beginner & intermediate level coders. The most popular chip is the NRF52840 for its excellent Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) capabiility. If you want to make a project with BLE there's no better chip than the NRF52840.

The projects in this section are specifically for NRF based boards running Circuit Python.
