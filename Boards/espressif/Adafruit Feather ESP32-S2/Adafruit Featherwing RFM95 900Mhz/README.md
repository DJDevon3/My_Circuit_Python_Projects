The Adafruit ESP32-S2 or S3 Feathers make excellent receiver (master) in your LORA network as it has WiFi functionality to:
- Notify AdafruitIO or your preferred IO service
- Get online time or other events
- Ensure any LORA messages are received & buffered
- Pass notifications using GPIO pins with lights or sound
