# Adafruit Featherwing LORA RFM95 with Feather ESP32-S2
### Online Time LORA Example by DJDevon3

This code includes *improved* error handling correction from my original commit. 

It will now gracefully revert back to looking for the time server and/or WiFi if SSID not found without crashing the program (hopefully).

This example requires a secrets.py file

Circuit Python 7.3.3

# Transmitter Output Example:
```py
Auto-reload is on. Simply save files over USB to run them or enter REPL to disable.
code.py output:

I used some random chat messages pasted from discord for the msg examples. It will send/receive long messages reliably now. When no message is received it goes into a timeout mode waiting for a new message, gracefully, without crashing the program. Also, has basic emoji support ðŸ™‚ if used with Mu.

The projects in this section are specifically for Adafruit ESP32-S2 based boards running Circuit Python.
