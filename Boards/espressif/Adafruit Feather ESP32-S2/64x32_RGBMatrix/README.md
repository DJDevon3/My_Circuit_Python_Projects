### Adafruit Feather ESP32-S2 + 64x32 RGB Matrix + RGB Matrix Featherwing
The simple test code is almost identical to the default RGB Matrix Featherwing M0/M4/RP2040 learn guide code.

This test was to confirm the combination of these components working together. 

The simpletest code does not include wifi.

Note: If you forget to hook up the external power supply to your Matrix panel only red LED's will work. Found that out the hard way. :P
