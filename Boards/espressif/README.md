Espressif has a wide variety of microcontroller boards with built-in Wi-Fi capability. Some are single core, some dual core,
all are powerful which makes them very popular boards within the maker communities. The most popular board that works with Circuit Python is easily the ESP32-S2.
The projects in this section are specifically for ESP based boards running Circuit Python.
