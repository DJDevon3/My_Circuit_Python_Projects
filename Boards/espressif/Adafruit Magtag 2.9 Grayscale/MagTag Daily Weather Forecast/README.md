I haven't modified this example at all. I'm just keeping a backup of my own 7.2.x files here while still testing the battery life.

I absolutely love my Magtag. Its deep sleep ability is unrivaled among any device I've ever used.

With a 10000mah battery (triple 18650 pack) it ran for 3 months without needing a recharge, updating the weather once per day.
