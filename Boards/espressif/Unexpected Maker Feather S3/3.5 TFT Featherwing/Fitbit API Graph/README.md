Fitbit API walkthrough for getting API Token & Initial Refresh Token
- Step 1: Create a personal app here: https://dev.fitbit.com
- Step 2: Use https://www.fitbit.com as the callback url
- Step 3: Use their Tutorial to get the Token and first Refresh Token
- Fitbit's Tutorial Step 4 is as far as you need to go.

- Because I'm using their example salt (PKCE Verifier) & I've already generated a new token after this guide... plus I'm generating a new refresh token every 15 minutes. I'm not the least bit worried about showing these tokens. 

Code.py Serial Output:
```py
Next token written to NVM Successfully!

- Fitbit Token only needs to be generated by the tutorial once and copied to settings.toml
- Refresh tokens automatically replace each other during normal script run updating every 15 minutes.
  
### microcontroller.nvm token storage
- The initial token is automatically replaced with the next refresh token.
- Next refresh token stored in Non-Volitile Memory (NVM)
- NVM token used during the next request (runs indefinitely).
- NVM token will persist after a hard reset, soft reboot, and even after installing a new UF2 release of Circuit Python! (except for Teensy Boards)
