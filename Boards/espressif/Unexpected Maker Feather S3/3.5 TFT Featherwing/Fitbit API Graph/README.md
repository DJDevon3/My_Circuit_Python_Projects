Fitbit API walkthrough for getting API Token & Initial Refresh Token
- Step 1: Create a personal app here: https://dev.fitbit.com
- Step 2: Use their Tutorial to get the Token and first Refresh Token
- Fitbit's Tutorial Step 4 is as far as you need to go.

- Because I'm using their example salt (PKCE Verifier) & I've already generated a new token after this guide... plus I'm generating a new refresh token every 15 minutes. I'm not the least bit worried about showing these tokens. 

Code.py Serial Output:
```py
Next token written to NVM Successfully!

To run the script forever without making a change to code.py
- Fitbit Token only needs to be generated by the tutorial once and copied to settings.toml
- Refresh tokens automatically replace each other during normal script run updating every 15 minutes.
  
### microcontroller.nvm token storage
- The initial token is automatically replaced with the next refresh token.
- Next refresh token stored in Non-Volitile Memory (NVM)
- In the event of a hard reset script will use the NVM token instead of initial token (should run forever).

### Using Fitbit's tutorial with this method
- no callback server is required after the SHA-256 API token and initial refresh token are added to settings.toml using their tutorial
