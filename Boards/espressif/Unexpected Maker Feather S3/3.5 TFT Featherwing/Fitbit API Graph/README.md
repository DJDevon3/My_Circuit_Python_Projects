Fitbit API walkthrough for getting API Token & Initial Refresh Token
- Step 1: Create a personal app here: https://dev.fitbit.com
- Step 2: Use https://www.fitbit.com as the callback url
- Step 3: Use their Tutorial to get the Token and first Refresh Token
- Fitbit's Tutorial Step 4 is as far as you need to go.

- Because I'm using their example salt (PKCE Verifier) & I've already generated a new token after this guide... plus I'm generating a new refresh token every 15 minutes. I'm not the least bit worried about showing these tokens. 

Code.py Serial Output:
```py
Next token written to NVM Successfully!

===============================
```
- SHA-256 Token expires every 8 hours
- SHA-256 Token & Refresh Token only needs to be generated by the tutorial once and copied to settings.toml
- Refresh tokens automatically replace each other updating every 15 minutes.
- The refresh token effectively acts as a "keep alive" token for the main SHA-256 token.
- As long as you continually feed new refresh tokens the SHA-256 token will stay alive indefinitely.
- If you do not make a request at least once every 8 hours you will need to generate new tokens using their tutorial.
  
### microcontroller.nvm token storage
- Settings.toml Refresh token automatically replaced with next refresh token.
- Next refresh token stored in Non-Volatile Memory (NVM)
- NVM token used during the next request (cycle repeats indefinitely).
- NVM token will persist through:
  - hard reset
  - soft reboot
  - entering bootloader mode
    - upgrading or reinstalling Circuit Python UF2! (except for Teensy Boards)
  - exiting bootloader mode
