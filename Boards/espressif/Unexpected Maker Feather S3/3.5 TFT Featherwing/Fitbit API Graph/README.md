Fitbit API walkthrough for getting API Token & Initial Refresh Token
- Step 1: Create a personal app here: https://dev.fitbit.com
- Step 2: Use their Tutorial to get the Token and first Refresh Token
- Fitbit's Tutorial Step 4 is as far as you need to go.

- Because I'm using their example salt (PKCE Verifier) & their refresh token expire every 8 hours. I'm not the least bit worried about showing these tokens. 

Code.py Serial Output:

To make a change to code.py while keeping refresh token valid
- Copy/paste the next refresh token into settings.toml any time you want to make a change to code.py
- Save settings.toml replacing Next Refresh Token with Initial Refresh Token manually, then immediately save code.py with new changes
- I will be looking for a way to automate this process in the future with file appends.

To run the script forever without making a change to code.py
- Fitbit Token only needs to be generated by the tutorial once and copied to settings.toml
- Refresh tokens automatically replace each other during normal script run updating every 15 minutes forever.
