# This project no longer works (deprecated) because OpenWeatherMaps API is no longer freely open to the public.

# ESP32-S3 Online-Offline Weatherstation
## (not recommended until stable S3 release)
- Connects to OpenWeatherMaps for location and timezone aware weather status
- Uses bme280 I2C Stemma sensors for offline data (room temp/humidity/pressure)
- Battery/Voltage Status on TFT Display
- Currently crashes regularly due to hardfault handler bug within S3 framework

## As seen on Adafruit's Circuit Python Day 2022 Show & Tell (8/19/2022)
