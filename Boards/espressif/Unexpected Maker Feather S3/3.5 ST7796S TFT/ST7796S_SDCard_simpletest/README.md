### ST7796S SD Card Simpletest (uses built-in sdcardio library)
- Tests the sd card reader built into the ST7796S display
- Shares the same SPI bus as the display so results will be output to the display in repl mode.
- Lists filenames of files on the sdcard

You'll want to ensure your sdcard has some files on it to display.
