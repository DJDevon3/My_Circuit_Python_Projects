ATMEL boards were some of the first microcontroller boards to run Arduino. 
They were very low power and fun to play with. More recent iterations with SAMD chips such as the **M0 & M4 series** are powerful enough to run Circuit Python. 
The projects in this section are specifically for SAMD boards running Circuit Python.
