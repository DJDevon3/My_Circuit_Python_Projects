# Circuit Python Microcontroller Boards
Projects running on Circuit Python capable boards. 

CircuitPython is a programming language designed to simplify experimenting and learning to code on low-cost microcontroller boards.

If a project blinks, shines, glows, sparkles, or moves around like a snake... it's probably running Circuit Python.
