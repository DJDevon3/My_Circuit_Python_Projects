Circuit Python 7.3 libraries needed in this sketch.

If you already have these libraries in your /lib folder on your Circuit Python device there's no need to grab these.

In fact, I recommend you get the latest up-to-date versions of these library files from the Circuit Python website.
They're included in the bundle here: https://circuitpython.org/libraries
You only need to transfer the libraries required for your sketch to your /lib folder.
Don't try to transfer the entire massive /lib bundle on your Feather, it will run out of space.
Only put the library files you actively need on your feather.
