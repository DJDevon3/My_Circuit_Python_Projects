I've re-organized projects by board type as some projects contain specific board or add-on board code. 

Adafruit Ecosystem Terminology:
- Board = Feather
  - Add-on Board = Featherwing
- Board = QT Py
  - Add-on Board = BFF
- Board = Trinket/ItsyBitsy
  - Add-on Board = Backpack
- Board = Rasperry Pi
  - Add-On Board = Hat/Bonnet
- Board = Arduino Uno form factor
  - Add-On Board = Shield


This structure should be easier for you to find compatible projects for inspiration or just to gank my code, either way works for me.
